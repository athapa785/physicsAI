## Introduction

Heat and temperature are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics that describe the energy transfer between systems and the microscopic motion of particles. Though we encounter these concepts daily—from cooking food to checking the weather forecast—they are often misunderstood or confused with one another. In physics, these terms have precise definitions that help us understand and predict thermal phenomena.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. It indicates how hot or cold an object is relative to another and determines the direction of spontaneous heat flow. Heat, on the other hand, is the energy transferred between objects due to a temperature difference. It is a form of energy in transit, not a property that an object possesses.

The study of heat and temperature has a rich history dating back to ancient civilizations, but it was during the 18th and 19th centuries that scientists like Joseph Black, James Prescott Joule, and Lord Kelvin established the foundations of modern thermodynamics. Their work led to the understanding that heat is a form of energy and to the development of the absolute temperature scale.

In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of heat and temperature, examine how they relate to each other, learn about heat transfer mechanisms, and investigate their applications in various fields. By understanding these concepts, you will gain insight into phenomena ranging from why metals feel colder than wood at the same temperature to how thermal energy is harnessed in power plants.

## Key Concepts and Principles

### Temperature

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It determines the direction of heat flow when objects are in thermal contact—heat always flows spontaneously from higher to lower temperatures.

Temperature is measured using various scales:

1. **Celsius Scale (°C)**: Based on the freezing point (0°C) and boiling point (100°C) of water at standard atmospheric pressure.

2. **Fahrenheit Scale (°F)**: Sets the freezing point of water at 32°F and the boiling point at 212°F at standard atmospheric pressure.

3. **Kelvin Scale (K)**: The SI unit of temperature. It starts at absolute zero (0 K), the theoretical temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. The size of a kelvin is the same as that of a degree Celsius.

4. **Rankine Scale (°R)**: An absolute temperature scale based on Fahrenheit degrees. Zero on the Rankine scale is absolute zero.

Conversions between these scales can be performed using the following formulas:
- Celsius to Kelvin: $T_K = T_C + 273.15$
- Celsius to Fahrenheit: $T_F = \frac{9}{5}T_C + 32$
- Fahrenheit to Celsius: $T_C = \frac{5}{9}(T_F - 32)$
- Fahrenheit to Rankine: $T_R = T_F + 459.67$
- Kelvin to Rankine: $T_R = \frac{9}{5}T_K$

### Thermal Equilibrium and the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics

The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This principle is the basis for temperature measurement—it allows us to use a thermometer as the third system to compare the temperatures of two objects.

Thermal equilibrium is reached when two objects in thermal contact no longer exchange net heat energy, meaning they have reached the same temperature.

### Heat

Heat is the energy transferred between objects due to a temperature difference. It is measured in joules (J) in the SI system, though calories (cal) and British Thermal Units (BTU) are also common units.

1 calorie = 4.186 joules
1 BTU = 1055 joules

Heat is not a property that an object possesses but rather energy in transit. Once the energy has been transferred, it becomes part of the internal energy of the receiving object.

### Specific Heat Capacity

The specific heat capacity (c) of a substance is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one unit of mass of the substance by one unit of temperature. In the SI system, it is measured in J/(kg K) or J/(kg °C).

The heat energy (Q) required to change the temperature of a mass (m) of a substance by ΔT is given by:

$$Q = mc\Delta T$$

Where:
- Q is the heat energy transferred (J)
- m is the mass of the substance (kg)
- c is the specific heat capacity of the substance (J/(kg K))
- ΔT is the change in temperature (K or °C)

Water has a remarkably high specific heat capacity of 4,186 J/(kg °C), which is why it takes a long time to heat up or cool down compared to other substances. This property of water plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate and is important in many industrial processes.

### Heat Capacity

Heat capacity (C) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of an entire object by one unit of temperature. It is related to specific heat capacity by:

$$C = mc$$

Where:
- C is the heat capacity (J/K)
- m is the mass of the object (kg)
- c is the specific heat capacity of the material (J/(kg K))

### Latent Heat

Latent heat is the energy required to change the phase of a substance without changing its temperature. During a phase change, the temperature remains constant while heat is added or removed.

The heat energy (Q) required for a phase change is given by:

$$Q = mL$$

Where:
- Q is the heat energy (J)
- m is the mass of the substance (kg)
- L is the specific latent heat for the particular phase change (J/kg)

There are several types of specific latent heat:

1. **Latent Heat of Fusion (Lf)**: The energy required to change a substance from solid to liquid at its melting point. For water, Lf = 334,000 J/kg at 0°C.

2. **Latent Heat of Vaporization (Lv)**: The energy required to change a substance from liquid to gas at its boiling point. For water, Lv = 2,260,000 J/kg at 100°C.

3. **Latent Heat of Sublimation**: The energy required to change a substance directly from solid to gas.

### Heat Transfer Mechanisms

Heat can be transferred through three main mechanisms:

1. **Conduction**: The transfer of heat through direct contact between particles. It occurs primarily in solids, especially metals, which have free electrons that can efficiently transfer energy. The rate of conductive heat transfer is given by Fourier's Law:

   $$\frac{Q}{t} = -kA\frac{dT}{dx}$$

   Where:
   - Q/t is the rate of heat transfer (W)
   - k is the thermal conductivity of the material (W/(m K))
   - A is the cross-sectional area (m²)
   - dT/dx is the temperature gradient (K/m)

   For a slab of material with thickness L and temperature difference ΔT between its faces, this simplifies to:

   $$\frac{Q}{t} = kA\frac{\Delta T}{L}$$

2. **Convection**: The transfer of heat by the bulk movement of a fluid (liquid or gas). As a fluid is heated, it expands, becomes less dense, and rises, creating a convection current. Convection can be natural (due to buoyancy) or forced (using fans or pumps). The rate of convective heat transfer is given by Newton's Law of Cooling:

   $$\frac{Q}{t} = hA\Delta T$$

   Where:
   - Q/t is the rate of heat transfer (W)
   - h is the convective heat transfer coefficient (W/(m² K))
   - A is the surface area (m²)
   - ΔT is the temperature difference between the surface and the fluid (K)

3. **Radiation**: The transfer of heat through electromagnetic waves, requiring no medium. All objects emit thermal radiation based on their temperature. The rate of radiative heat transfer is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:

   $$\frac{Q}{t} = \sigma \varepsilon A T^4$$

   Where:
   - Q/t is the rate of heat transfer (W)
   - σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 × 10⁻⁸ W/(m² K⁴))
   - ε is the emissivity of the surface (dimensionless, between 0 and 1)
   - A is the surface area (m²)
   - T is the absolute temperature of the surface (K)

   The net radiative heat transfer between two surfaces at temperatures T₁ and T₂ is:

   $$\frac{Q}{t} = \sigma \varepsilon A (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$$

### Thermal Expansion

Most materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. The change in length (ΔL) of a solid due to a temperature change (ΔT) is given by:

$$\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$$

Where:
- ΔL is the change in length (m)
- α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient (K⁻¹)
- L₀ is the initial length (m)
- ΔT is the change in temperature (K)

Similarly, the change in volume (ΔV) is given by:

$$\Delta V = \beta V_0 \Delta T$$

Where:
- ΔV is the change in volume (m³)
- β is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient (K⁻¹)
- V₀ is the initial volume (m³)
- ΔT is the change in temperature (K)

For isotropic materials, β ≈ 3α.

### First Law of Thermodynamics

The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of energy conservation. It states that the change in internal energy (ΔU) of a system equals the heat added to the system (Q) minus the work done by the system (W):

$$\Delta U = Q - W$$

This law helps us understand how heat transfer affects the internal energy of a system and how this energy can be converted to work or vice versa.

## Example Problems with Solutions

### Example 1: Specific Heat Capacity

**Problem:** A 0.5 kg aluminum pot (specific heat capacity = 900 J/(kg °C)) containing 1.5 kg of water (specific heat capacity = 4,186 J/(kg °C)) is heated from 20°C to 80°C. How much heat energy is required for this temperature change?

**Solution:**

The heat energy required is the sum of the heat needed to raise the temperature of the aluminum pot and the water:

$Q_{total} = Q_{aluminum} + Q_{water}$

For the aluminum pot:
$Q_{aluminum} = m_{aluminum} \times c_{aluminum} \times \Delta T$
$Q_{aluminum} = 0.5 \text{ kg} \times 900 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (80 - 20)\text{ °C}$
$Q_{aluminum} = 0.5 \text{ kg} \times 900 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 60\text{ °C}$
$Q_{aluminum} = 27,000 \text{ J} = 27 \text{ kJ}$

For the water:
$Q_{water} = m_{water} \times c_{water} \times \Delta T$
$Q_{water} = 1.5 \text{ kg} \times 4,186 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (80 - 20)\text{ °C}$
$Q_{water} = 1.5 \text{ kg} \times 4,186 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 60\text{ °C}$
$Q_{water} = 376,740 \text{ J} = 376.74 \text{ kJ}$

Total heat energy required:
$Q_{total} = 27 \text{ kJ} + 376.74 \text{ kJ} = 403.74 \text{ kJ}$

Therefore, 403.74 kJ of heat energy is required to raise the temperature of the pot and water from 20°C to 80°C.

### Example 2: Phase Change

**Problem:** How much heat energy is required to convert 2.0 kg of ice at -10°C to steam at 120°C? Given:
- Specific heat capacity of ice = 2,090 J/(kg °C)
- Specific heat capacity of water = 4,186 J/(kg °C)
- Specific heat capacity of steam = 2,010 J/(kg °C)
- Latent heat of fusion of ice = 334,000 J/kg
- Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260,000 J/kg

**Solution:**

This process involves five steps:
1. Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C
2. Melting ice at 0°C
3. Heating water from 0°C to 100°C
4. Vaporizing water at 100°C
5. Heating steam from 100°C to 120°C

Step 1: Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C
$Q_1 = m \times c_{ice} \times \Delta T$
$Q_1 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 2,090 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (0 - (-10))\text{ °C}$
$Q_1 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 2,090 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 10\text{ °C}$
$Q_1 = 41,800 \text{ J} = 41.8 \text{ kJ}$

Step 2: Melting ice at 0°C
$Q_2 = m \times L_f$
$Q_2 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 334,000 \text{ J/kg}$
$Q_2 = 668,000 \text{ J} = 668 \text{ kJ}$

Step 3: Heating water from 0°C to 100°C
$Q_3 = m \times c_{water} \times \Delta T$
$Q_3 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 4,186 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (100 - 0)\text{ °C}$
$Q_3 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 4,186 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 100\text{ °C}$
$Q_3 = 837,200 \text{ J} = 837.2 \text{ kJ}$

Step 4: Vaporizing water at 100°C
$Q_4 = m \times L_v$
$Q_4 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 2,260,000 \text{ J/kg}$
$Q_4 = 4,520,000 \text{ J} = 4,520 \text{ kJ}$

Step 5: Heating steam from 100°C to 120°C
$Q_5 = m \times c_{steam} \times \Delta T$
$Q_5 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 2,010 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (120 - 100)\text{ °C}$
$Q_5 = 2.0 \text{ kg} \times 2,010 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times 20\text{ °C}$
$Q_5 = 80,400 \text{ J} = 80.4 \text{ kJ}$

Total heat energy required:
$Q_{total} = Q_1 + Q_2 + Q_3 + Q_4 + Q_5$
$Q_{total} = 41.8 + 668 + 837.2 + 4,520 + 80.4 = 6,147.4 \text{ kJ}$

Therefore, 6,147.4 kJ of heat energy is required to convert 2.0 kg of ice at -10°C to steam at 120°C.

### Example 3: Heat Conduction

**Problem:** A wall of a house is 4.0 m high, 6.0 m wide, and 20 cm thick. It is made of brick with a thermal conductivity of 0.84 W/(m K). If the temperature inside the house is 22°C and the temperature outside is -5°C, calculate the rate of heat loss through the wall.

**Solution:**

Using Fourier's Law for heat conduction:

$\frac{Q}{t} = kA\frac{\Delta T}{L}$

Where:
- k is the thermal conductivity of brick = 0.84 W/(m K)
- A is the area of the wall = 4.0 m × 6.0 m = 24.0 m²
- ΔT is the temperature difference = (22 - (-5))°C = 27°C = 27 K
- L is the thickness of the wall = 20 cm = 0.20 m

$\frac{Q}{t} = 0.84 \text{ W/(m K)} \times 24.0 \text{ m}^2 \times \frac{27 \text{ K}}{0.20 \text{ m}}$
$\frac{Q}{t} = 0.84 \text{ W/(m K)} \times 24.0 \text{ m}^2 \times 135 \text{ K/m}$
$\frac{Q}{t} = 2,721.6 \text{ W} = 2.72 \text{ kW}$

Therefore, the rate of heat loss through the wall is 2.72 kW.

### Example 4: Thermal Expansion

**Problem:** A steel bridge is 50.0 m long at 10°C. What is the change in length of the bridge when the temperature rises to 40°C? The linear thermal expansion coefficient of steel is 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹.

**Solution:**

Using the formula for linear thermal expansion:

$\Delta L = \alpha L_0 \Delta T$

Where:
- α is the linear thermal expansion coefficient of steel = 1.2 × 10⁻⁵ K⁻¹
- L₀ is the initial length of the bridge = 50.0 m
- ΔT is the change in temperature = (40 - 10)°C = 30°C = 30 K

$\Delta L = 1.2 \times 10^{-5} \text{ K}^{-1} \times 50.0 \text{ m} \times 30 \text{ K}$
$\Delta L = 1.8 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m} = 1.8 \text{ cm}$

Therefore, the bridge will expand by 1.8 cm when the temperature rises from 10°C to 40°C.

### Example 5: Mixing of Substances at Different Temperatures

**Problem:** A 200 g copper mug (specific heat capacity = 386 J/(kg °C)) at 20°C is filled with 300 g of coffee at 90°C. Assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings, what is the final equilibrium temperature of the coffee and mug?

**Solution:**

When two objects at different temperatures come into thermal contact, heat flows from the hotter object to the cooler one until thermal equilibrium is reached. The heat lost by the hotter object equals the heat gained by the cooler object:

$Q_{lost} = Q_{gained}$

Let's denote the final equilibrium temperature as $T_f$.

Heat lost by the coffee:
$Q_{lost} = m_{coffee} \times c_{coffee} \times (90 - T_f)$

Assuming coffee has approximately the same specific heat capacity as water (4,186 J/(kg °C)):
$Q_{lost} = 0.300 \text{ kg} \times 4,186 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (90 - T_f)\text{ °C}$
$Q_{lost} = 1,255.8 \times (90 - T_f) \text{ J}$

Heat gained by the copper mug:
$Q_{gained} = m_{mug} \times c_{mug} \times (T_f - 20)$
$Q_{gained} = 0.200 \text{ kg} \times 386 \text{ J/(kg °C)} \times (T_f - 20)\text{ °C}$
$Q_{gained} = 77.2 \times (T_f - 20) \text{ J}$

Setting these equal:
$1,255.8 \times (90 - T_f) = 77.2 \times (T_f - 20)$
$113,022 - 1,255.8T_f = 77.2T_f - 1,544$
$113,022 + 1,544 = 1,255.8T_f + 77.2T_f$
$114,566 = 1,333T_f$
$T_f = \frac{114,566}{1,333} = 85.9\text{ °C}$

Therefore, the final equilibrium temperature of the coffee and mug is approximately 85.9°C.

Heat and temperature are fundamental concepts in thermodynamics that help us understand and predict a wide range of phenomena in both natural and engineered systems. From the simple act of brewing coffee to complex industrial processes, the principles of heat transfer and temperature regulation play crucial roles. By mastering these concepts, we gain powerful tools for analyzing thermal systems and developing technologies that harness thermal energy for human benefit.
