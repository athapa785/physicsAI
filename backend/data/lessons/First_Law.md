## 1. Key Concepts and Principles

Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia, states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion, with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by a net external force. This law is fundamental to our understanding of how objects move.

### Objects at Rest

An object will remain at rest unless an external force acts upon it. If you leave a book on your desk, it won't move on its own.

### Objects in Motion

Similarly, an object in motion continues to move with the same speed and in the same direction, unless a net external force acts on it. If you slide a puck on an air hockey table, it will continue to slide in a straight line until it hits something (like the wall) or friction slows it down.

### Inertia

Inertia is the resistance of an object to a change in its state of motion. The more mass an object has, the more inertia it has, and the harder it is to change its motion. 

## 2. Important Formulas

The First Law doesn't come with a separate formula, but it sets the foundation for the Second Law. We can express the First Law in terms of the Second Law's formula, which is:

$$ F = ma $$

When the net external force ($F$) is zero, acceleration ($a$) is also zero. This means the object's velocity (speed with direction) remains constant, which is the essence of the First Law.

## 3. Real-World Applications

Newton's First Law of Motion is evident in everyday life:

- Seatbelts: When a car suddenly stops, the passenger tends to keep moving forward due to their inertia. Seatbelts exert a force to stop the passenger's motion.

- Space Travel: In the vacuum of space, an astronaut or a spacecraft will keep moving in the same direction at the same speed until a force is applied.

- Sports: In soccer, a stationary ball will not start moving until a player applies a force by kicking it. Once kicked, it will keep moving until another force (like friction with the ground, or a goalkeeper's hands) stops it.

## 4. Example Problems with Solutions

### Problem 1:

You slide a box across a frictionless floor. After you stop pushing it, what happens to the box?

**Solution:**

According to Newton's First Law, an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Since the floor is frictionless, there are no unbalanced forces acting on the box after you stop pushing it, so it will continue to move at a constant speed in the same direction.

### Problem 2:

A car moving at a speed of 60 km/hr is brought to rest by applying brakes in 10 seconds. What force is applied by the brakes if the car's mass is 1000 kg?

**Solution:**

First, we need to find the acceleration using the formula $a = \frac{{v_f - v_i}}{{t}}$. Here, $v_f$ (final velocity) is 0 (as the car comes to rest), $v_i$ (initial velocity) is 60 km/hr (which we convert to m/s by multiplying by 5/18 to get 16.67 m/s), and $t$ (time) is 10 seconds. So, $a = \frac{{0 - 16.67}}{{10}} = -1.67$ m/s² (the negative sign indicates deceleration).

Then, we can find the force using $F = ma$. Here, $m$ is 1000 kg and $a$ is -1.67 m/s². So, $F = 1000 \times -1.67 = -1670$ N. The negative sign indicates that the force is applied in the opposite direction to the car's motion.
