## Introduction

Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) represents one of the most fundamental and widely observed types of motion in nature. From the swinging of a pendulum to the vibration of atoms in a molecule, SHM provides a mathematical framework for understanding oscillatory behavior in physical systems.

At its core, SHM occurs when a restoring force acts on an object, pulling it back toward an equilibrium position with a magnitude proportional to the displacement from that equilibrium. This relationship leads to a characteristic oscillatory motion where the object moves back and forth, repeatedly passing through its equilibrium position.

The beauty of SHM lies in its mathematical simplicity and its wide applicability. The same equations that describe a mass bouncing on a spring can be applied to understand electrical circuits, sound waves, and even quantum mechanical systems. This makes SHM a cornerstone concept in physics, engineering, and many other scientific disciplines.

In this lesson, we'll explore the mathematical description of SHM, examine its energy considerations, and investigate various physical systems that exhibit this type of motion.

## Key Concepts and Principles

### Definition of Simple Harmonic Motion

Simple Harmonic Motion is defined as the motion of an object where:

1. The acceleration of the object is directly proportional to its displacement from equilibrium.
2. The acceleration is always directed toward the equilibrium position.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

$$a = -\omega^2 x$$

Where:
- $a$ is the acceleration
- $x$ is the displacement from equilibrium
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation (in radians per second)

The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is always in the direction opposite to the displacement (i.e., toward equilibrium).

### Differential Equation of SHM

From Newton's Second Law ($F = ma$) and the definition of SHM, we can write:

$$m \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -m\omega^2 x$$

Simplifying:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2 x = 0$$

This is the differential equation that describes SHM. Its general solution is:

$$x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)$$

Where:
- $A$ is the amplitude (maximum displacement from equilibrium)
- $\omega$ is the angular frequency
- $\phi$ is the phase constant (determined by initial conditions)
- $t$ is time

### Velocity and Acceleration in SHM

The velocity in SHM can be found by differentiating the position function:

$$v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = -A\omega\sin(\omega t + \phi)$$

The acceleration is the derivative of velocity:

$$a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -A\omega^2\cos(\omega t + \phi) = -\omega^2 x(t)$$

This confirms our initial definition that acceleration is proportional to displacement and in the opposite direction.

### Period and Frequency

The period ($T$) of SHM is the time taken to complete one full oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency by:

$$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$

The frequency ($f$) is the number of oscillations per unit time:

$$f = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}$$

The SI unit of frequency is hertz (Hz), which is equivalent to cycles per second.

### Energy in Simple Harmonic Motion

In SHM, energy continuously transforms between kinetic and potential forms while the total mechanical energy remains constant (in the absence of friction or other dissipative forces).

The kinetic energy is:

$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}mA^2\omega^2\sin^2(\omega t + \phi)$$

The potential energy (for a spring system) is:

$$U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2\cos^2(\omega t + \phi)$$

Where $k$ is the spring constant. Since $\omega^2 = \frac{k}{m}$ for a spring-mass system, we can rewrite the potential energy as:

$$U = \frac{1}{2}mA^2\omega^2\cos^2(\omega t + \phi)$$

The total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies:

$$E = K + U = \frac{1}{2}mA^2\omega^2[\sin^2(\omega t + \phi) + \cos^2(\omega t + \phi)] = \frac{1}{2}mA^2\omega^2$$

Since $\sin^2 + \cos^2 = 1$, the total energy is constant and depends only on the amplitude and angular frequency.

### Common SHM Systems

1. **Mass on a Spring**:
   When a mass $m$ is attached to an ideal spring with spring constant $k$, the angular frequency is:
   $$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}$$
   The period is:
   $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$$

2. **Simple Pendulum**:
   For small oscillations (where $\sin\theta \approx \theta$), a pendulum of length $L$ exhibits SHM with angular frequency:
   $$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$$
   The period is:
   $$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$
   where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

3. **Physical Pendulum**:
   A rigid body oscillating about a pivot point has angular frequency:
   $$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{mgd}{I}}$$
   where $I$ is the moment of inertia about the pivot, $m$ is the mass, and $d$ is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass.

4. **LC Circuit**:
   An electrical circuit with an inductor ($L$) and capacitor ($C$) oscillates with angular frequency:
   $$\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}$$

### Damped Harmonic Motion

In real systems, energy is often dissipated due to friction or resistance, causing the amplitude to decrease over time. This is called damped harmonic motion, described by:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\beta\frac{dx}{dt} + \omega_0^2 x = 0$$

Where $\beta$ is the damping coefficient and $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the undamped system.

The solution depends on the degree of damping:

1. **Underdamped** ($\beta < \omega_0$): The system oscillates with decreasing amplitude.
   $$x(t) = Ae^{-\beta t}\cos(\omega't + \phi)$$
   where $\omega' = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}$

2. **Critically Damped** ($\beta = \omega_0$): The system returns to equilibrium without oscillating, in the shortest possible time.
   $$x(t) = (A + Bt)e^{-\beta t}$$

3. **Overdamped** ($\beta > \omega_0$): The system returns to equilibrium without oscillating, but more slowly than the critically damped case.
   $$x(t) = Ae^{-\alpha t} + Be^{-\gamma t}$$
   where $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are constants determined by $\beta$ and $\omega_0$.

### Forced Oscillations and Resonance

When an external periodic force is applied to a system capable of SHM, we have forced oscillations. The equation of motion becomes:

$$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\beta\frac{dx}{dt} + \omega_0^2 x = F_0\cos(\omega_d t)$$

Where $F_0$ is the amplitude of the driving force and $\omega_d$ is the driving frequency.

After initial transients die out, the system oscillates at the driving frequency with an amplitude that depends on how close $\omega_d$ is to $\omega_0$. When $\omega_d \approx \omega_0$, the amplitude becomes very large, a phenomenon known as resonance.

The amplitude of steady-state oscillations is:

$$A = \frac{F_0/m}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega_d^2)^2 + 4\beta^2\omega_d^2}}$$

This reaches a maximum when $\omega_d$ is close to $\omega_0$, with the exact resonant frequency being slightly less than $\omega_0$ for damped systems.

## Example Problems with Solutions

### Example 1: Mass-Spring System

**Problem:** A 0.5 kg mass is attached to a spring with spring constant 20 N/m. If the mass is pulled 10 cm from equilibrium and released from rest, determine:
a) The angular frequency
b) The period
c) The maximum velocity
d) The position function
e) The total energy

**Solution:**

Given:
- Mass ($m$) = 0.5 kg
- Spring constant ($k$) = 20 N/m
- Amplitude ($A$) = 10 cm = 0.1 m
- Initial velocity = 0

a) The angular frequency is:
$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{20 \text{ N/m}}{0.5 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{40 \text{ s}^{-2}} = 6.32 \text{ rad/s}$$

b) The period is:
$$T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{6.32 \text{ rad/s}} = 0.99 \text{ s}$$

c) The maximum velocity occurs when the mass passes through the equilibrium position:
$$v_{max} = A\omega = 0.1 \text{ m} \times 6.32 \text{ rad/s} = 0.632 \text{ m/s}$$

d) Since the mass is released from rest at maximum displacement, the phase constant $\phi = 0$. The position function is:
$$x(t) = A\cos(\omega t) = 0.1 \text{ m} \times \cos(6.32t \text{ rad/s})$$

e) The total energy is:
$$E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 \text{ N/m} \times (0.1 \text{ m})^2 = 0.1 \text{ J}$$

Alternatively, using $E = \frac{1}{2}mA^2\omega^2$:
$$E = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.5 \text{ kg} \times (0.1 \text{ m})^2 \times (6.32 \text{ rad/s})^2 = 0.1 \text{ J}$$

### Example 2: Simple Pendulum

**Problem:** A simple pendulum has a length of 1.2 m. Calculate:
a) The period of oscillation
b) The maximum speed of the bob if the maximum angular displacement is 5 degrees

**Solution:**

Given:
- Length ($L$) = 1.2 m
- Maximum angular displacement ($\theta_{max}$) = 5° = 0.0873 rad
- Acceleration due to gravity ($g$) = 9.8 m/s²

a) The period of a simple pendulum is:
$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{1.2 \text{ m}}{9.8 \text{ m/s}^2}} = 2\pi\sqrt{0.1224 \text{ s}^2} = 2.2 \text{ s}$$

b) First, find the angular frequency:
$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} = \sqrt{\frac{9.8 \text{ m/s}^2}{1.2 \text{ m}}} = 2.86 \text{ rad/s}$$

For small oscillations, the motion of the bob can be approximated as SHM with amplitude $A = L\sin\theta_{max} \approx L\theta_{max}$ (for small angles).

$$A = 1.2 \text{ m} \times 0.0873 \text{ rad} = 0.105 \text{ m}$$

The maximum speed is:
$$v_{max} = A\omega = 0.105 \text{ m} \times 2.86 \text{ rad/s} = 0.3 \text{ m/s}$$

### Example 3: Damped Oscillations

**Problem:** A damped oscillator has a mass of 0.2 kg, spring constant of 8 N/m, and damping constant of 0.4 kg/s. Determine:
a) The undamped angular frequency
b) The damping coefficient
c) Whether the system is underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped
d) If underdamped, what is the frequency of damped oscillations?

**Solution:**

Given:
- Mass ($m$) = 0.2 kg
- Spring constant ($k$) = 8 N/m
- Damping constant ($b$) = 0.4 kg/s

a) The undamped angular frequency is:
$$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{8 \text{ N/m}}{0.2 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{40 \text{ s}^{-2}} = 6.32 \text{ rad/s}$$

b) The damping coefficient is:
$$\beta = \frac{b}{2m} = \frac{0.4 \text{ kg/s}}{2 \times 0.2 \text{ kg}} = 1 \text{ s}^{-1}$$

c) To determine the type of damping, compare $\beta$ and $\omega_0$:
- If $\beta < \omega_0$: Underdamped
- If $\beta = \omega_0$: Critically damped
- If $\beta > \omega_0$: Overdamped

Since $\beta = 1 \text{ s}^{-1}$ and $\omega_0 = 6.32 \text{ rad/s}$, we have $\beta < \omega_0$, so the system is underdamped.

d) The frequency of damped oscillations is:
$$\omega' = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \beta^2} = \sqrt{(6.32 \text{ rad/s})^2 - (1 \text{ s}^{-1})^2} = \sqrt{39 \text{ s}^{-2}} = 6.24 \text{ rad/s}$$

The damped frequency is slightly less than the undamped frequency.

### Example 4: Forced Oscillations and Resonance

**Problem:** A forced oscillator consists of a 0.3 kg mass attached to a spring with spring constant 12 N/m. The damping constant is 0.6 kg/s, and a periodic force with amplitude 2 N is applied. Calculate:
a) The natural frequency of the system
b) The resonant frequency
c) The amplitude of oscillation when the driving frequency is equal to the resonant frequency

**Solution:**

Given:
- Mass ($m$) = 0.3 kg
- Spring constant ($k$) = 12 N/m
- Damping constant ($b$) = 0.6 kg/s
- Force amplitude ($F_0$) = 2 N

a) The natural (undamped) angular frequency is:
$$\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{12 \text{ N/m}}{0.3 \text{ kg}}} = \sqrt{40 \text{ s}^{-2}} = 6.32 \text{ rad/s}$$

The natural frequency is:
$$f_0 = \frac{\omega_0}{2\pi} = \frac{6.32 \text{ rad/s}}{2\pi} = 1.01 \text{ Hz}$$

b) The damping coefficient is:
$$\beta = \frac{b}{2m} = \frac{0.6 \text{ kg/s}}{2 \times 0.3 \text{ kg}} = 1 \text{ s}^{-1}$$

For a damped system, the resonant frequency is slightly less than the natural frequency:
$$\omega_r = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - 2\beta^2} = \sqrt{(6.32 \text{ rad/s})^2 - 2(1 \text{ s}^{-1})^2} = \sqrt{38 \text{ s}^{-2}} = 6.16 \text{ rad/s}$$

c) The amplitude at resonance is:
$$A_{res} = \frac{F_0/m}{2\beta\omega_r} = \frac{2 \text{ N} / 0.3 \text{ kg}}{2 \times 1 \text{ s}^{-1} \times 6.16 \text{ rad/s}} = \frac{6.67 \text{ m/s}^2}{12.32 \text{ rad/s}^2} = 0.54 \text{ m}$$

At the resonant frequency, the system oscillates with an amplitude of 0.54 m.
