First Law of Thermodynamics

The First Law of Thermodynamics is a statement of conservation of energy that includes heat transfer. It states that the change in internal energy of a system equals the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system: ΔU = Q - W.

Internal energy (U) represents the total energy contained within a system, including the kinetic and potential energies of its constituent particles. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature.

Heat (Q) is energy transferred due to temperature differences. By convention, Q > 0 when heat is added to the system, and Q < 0 when heat is removed from the system.

Work (W) in thermodynamics is often expressed as pressure-volume work: W = P·ΔV. By convention, W > 0 when work is done by the system (expansion), and W < 0 when work is done on the system (compression).

Thermodynamic processes are classified based on which variables remain constant:
1. Isothermal process: Temperature remains constant (ΔT = 0)
2. Adiabatic process: No heat transfer (Q = 0)
3. Isobaric process: Pressure remains constant (ΔP = 0)
4. Isochoric/Isovolumetric process: Volume remains constant (ΔV = 0)

The First Law provides a framework for analyzing energy transfers in physical and chemical processes, from engines to biological systems.
