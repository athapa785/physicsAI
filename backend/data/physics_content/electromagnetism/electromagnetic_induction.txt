Electromagnetic Induction

Electromagnetic induction is the production of an electromotive force (EMF) across an electrical conductor in a changing magnetic field. This phenomenon, discovered by Michael Faraday, forms the basis for many electrical devices.

Faraday's Law of Induction states that the induced EMF in a circuit is equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux through the circuit: ε = -dΦ/dt. The magnetic flux Φ is defined as Φ = ∫B·dA, the surface integral of the magnetic field through the area enclosed by the circuit.

Lenz's Law, which follows from conservation of energy, states that the direction of the induced current is such that it creates a magnetic field that opposes the change in flux that produced it. This explains the negative sign in Faraday's Law.

Inductance (L) is a property of a conductor by which a change in current through it induces an EMF. Self-inductance refers to the EMF induced in the same circuit, while mutual inductance refers to the EMF induced in a nearby circuit. The unit of inductance is the henry (H).

Transformers use electromagnetic induction to change AC voltage levels. They consist of two coils (primary and secondary) wound around a common iron core. The voltage ratio equals the turns ratio: V₂/V₁ = N₂/N₁.

Generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy using electromagnetic induction. When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, the changing flux induces an alternating EMF, producing AC electricity.
