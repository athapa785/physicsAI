Magnetic Fields

Magnetic fields are vector fields that exert forces on moving charges and magnetic materials. The magnetic field B is measured in teslas (T).

A moving charge creates a magnetic field. For a current-carrying wire, the magnetic field follows the right-hand rule, with field lines forming concentric circles around the wire. The magnitude of the field at distance r from a long, straight wire is given by B = (μ₀I)/(2πr), where μ₀ is the permeability of free space and I is the current.

Magnetic force on a moving charge is given by F = qv × B, where q is the charge, v is the velocity, and B is the magnetic field. This force is always perpendicular to both the velocity and the magnetic field, resulting in circular motion when a charged particle moves perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field.

For a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field, the force per unit length is F/L = I × B. This principle is the basis for electric motors.

Magnetic materials contain microscopic current loops due to electron orbits and spins. They are classified as:
1. Ferromagnetic: Strongly attracted to magnets (iron, nickel, cobalt)
2. Paramagnetic: Weakly attracted to magnets
3. Diamagnetic: Weakly repelled by magnets

Magnetic field lines always form closed loops, unlike electric field lines which begin on positive charges and end on negative charges. This reflects the absence of magnetic monopoles in nature.
