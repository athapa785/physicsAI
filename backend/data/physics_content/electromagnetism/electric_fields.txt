# Electric Fields and Forces

## Key Concepts
- Electric charge and Coulomb's law
- Electric field lines and field strength
- Electric potential and potential difference
- Conductors and insulators
- Gauss's law

## Mathematical Formulas
- Coulomb's law: \(F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\)
- Electric field: \(E = \frac{F}{q} = k\frac{Q}{r^2}\)
- Electric potential: \(V = k\frac{Q}{r}\)
- Electric potential energy: \(U = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r}\)
- Gauss's law: \(\oint \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}\)

## Example
Two point charges, q₁ = 2μC and q₂ = -3μC, are separated by 0.1m.
Calculate:
a) The electric force between them
b) The electric field at the midpoint

Solution:
1. Electric force:
   \(F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\)
   \(F = (9 \times 10^9)\frac{(2 \times 10^{-6})(-3 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.1)^2}\)
   \(F = -5.4\text{ N}\) (attractive force)

2. Electric field at midpoint:
   From q₁: \(E_1 = k\frac{q_1}{(0.05)^2} = 7.2 \times 10^6\text{ N/C}\)
   From q₂: \(E_2 = k\frac{q_2}{(0.05)^2} = -10.8 \times 10^6\text{ N/C}\)
   Net field: \(E_{net} = -3.6 \times 10^6\text{ N/C}\) (toward q₂)
