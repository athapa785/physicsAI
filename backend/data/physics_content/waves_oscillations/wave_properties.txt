Wave Properties

Waves are disturbances that transfer energy without transferring matter. They are characterized by several key properties:

Amplitude (A) is the maximum displacement from equilibrium. It determines the energy carried by the wave, with energy proportional to the square of the amplitude (E ∝ A²).

Wavelength (λ) is the distance between consecutive corresponding points on a wave, such as from crest to crest or trough to trough.

Frequency (f) is the number of complete oscillations per unit time, measured in hertz (Hz). It is related to the period (T) by f = 1/T.

Wave speed (v) is the rate at which the wave propagates through a medium. It is related to wavelength and frequency by v = λf.

Wave equations describe the mathematical form of waves. For a sinusoidal wave traveling in the x-direction, the displacement y can be expressed as y(x,t) = A·sin(kx - ωt), where k = 2π/λ is the wave number and ω = 2πf is the angular frequency.

Waves exhibit several phenomena:
1. Reflection: Waves bounce off boundaries
2. Refraction: Waves change direction when entering a different medium
3. Diffraction: Waves bend around obstacles or through openings
4. Interference: Waves superimpose to create patterns of reinforcement and cancellation
5. Doppler effect: Frequency changes when there is relative motion between source and observer
