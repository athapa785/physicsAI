# Newton's Laws of Motion

## Key Concepts
- First Law: An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net force
- Second Law: \(ec{F} = mec{a}\)
- Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction

## Applications
1. Weight and Normal Force
- Weight: \(ec{W} = mec{g}\)
- Normal force balances weight on horizontal surfaces

2. Tension and Friction
- Tension in ropes and strings
- Static friction: \(f_s \leq \mu_s N\)
- Kinetic friction: \(f_k = \mu_k N\)

## Example
A 2kg block is pulled across a rough surface (μₖ = 0.3) by a 10N force at 30° above horizontal.
Find:
a) Normal force
b) Friction force
c) Acceleration

Solution:
1. Forces in y-direction:
   \(N + F\sin(30°) - mg = 0\)
   \(N = 19.6 - 5 = 14.6	ext{ N}\)

2. Friction force:
   \(f_k = \mu_k N = 0.3(14.6) = 4.38	ext{ N}\)

3. Net force in x-direction:
   \(F_{	ext{net}} = F\cos(30°) - f_k = 8.66 - 4.38 = 4.28	ext{ N}\)
   \(a = rac{F_{	ext{net}}}{m} = rac{4.28}{2} = 2.14	ext{ m/s}^2\)
