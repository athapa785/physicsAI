Work and Energy in Mechanics

Work is defined as the product of force and displacement in the direction of the force. The mathematical expression for work is W = F·d·cosθ, where F is the force, d is the displacement, and θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

Energy exists in various forms, with the most relevant in mechanics being kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, given by KE = (1/2)mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. Potential energy is stored energy due to position or configuration, with gravitational potential energy given by PE = mgh, where g is the gravitational acceleration and h is height.

The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy: W_net = ΔKE. This fundamental principle connects the concepts of force, displacement, and energy.

Conservation of energy is one of the most important principles in physics, stating that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In a closed system, the total energy remains constant.
