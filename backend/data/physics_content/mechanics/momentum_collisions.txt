Momentum and Collisions

Linear momentum is defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity: p = mv. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction. The SI unit for momentum is kg·m/s.

The law of conservation of momentum states that in a closed system (no external forces), the total momentum before an event equals the total momentum after the event. Mathematically, this is expressed as: p₁ + p₂ = p₁' + p₂'.

Collisions are classified into three types:
1. Elastic collisions: Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. These are ideal collisions where no energy is lost.
2. Inelastic collisions: Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not. Some energy is converted to other forms like heat or sound.
3. Completely inelastic collisions: Objects stick together after collision. Momentum is conserved, but the maximum amount of kinetic energy is lost.

Impulse is defined as the change in momentum and equals the force applied multiplied by the time interval: J = F·Δt = Δp. This relationship is useful for analyzing impacts and collisions where forces act for short durations.
