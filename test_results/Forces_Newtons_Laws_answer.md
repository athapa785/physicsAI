# Question: What is Newton's Second Law and how is it mathematically expressed?

# Topic: Forces Newtons Laws

# Answer:

Newton's Second Law of Motion states that the acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. This relationship can be mathematically expressed as follows:

$$\vec{F} = m\vec{a}$$

In this equation, $\vec{F}$ represents the net force applied to the object, $m$ represents the mass of the object, and $\vec{a}$ represents the acceleration of the object. The vectors denote the directionality of these quantities.

This law implies that the net force on an object is equal to the rate of change of its linear momentum in an inertial reference frame. The law is applicable even for particles and objects irrespective of their shape and size. 

Applying this law, one can determine the net force acting on an object if the mass and acceleration of the object are known. Conversely, if the net force and the mass of the object are known, one can determine the object's acceleration. 

For example, consider a 2kg block being pulled across a rough surface by a 10N force. The application of Newton's Second Law allows us to calculate the acceleration of the block as follows:

$$a = \frac{F_{\text{net}}}{m} = \frac{4.28}{2} = 2.14 \, \text{m/s}^2$$

In this example, $F_{\text{net}}$ represents the net force acting on the block, which is the difference between the applied force and the frictional force, $m$ represents the mass of the block, and $a$ represents the acceleration of the block. The direction of the acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force.
